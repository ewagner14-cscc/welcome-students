# To Improve

```
At time the VM were not available and there were no advnaced notifications for any maintenance or outages.
---
VM needs patches for updated component installs
---
I wish we could set this up on a virtual machine in our personal systems so we could have an up to date system. It could be a system image of something linux based
---
VM hiccups - sticky key was 'C' which made copying really annoying. I wasn't sure how to disable it
---
VM's were super slow, especially at night
---
The VM was frustrating and not a good experience. I needed to set up a working Ubuntu VM on my personal PC to complete labs. I fell behind in course work until I was fully operational. I would recommend developing instructions for students to do this is desired in the future.

The Zoom chats were not available after the class. It would have been helpful to have access to the chat as it contained useful resources. Eric did a good job of sending the important links via email after the class.

For Pre-requisites, it would have been helpful if we got access to Eric's github cheat sheet a few weeks before the class started. That would have helped some of us get upto speed on git.

# Suggestions

```
To aid in retention of content what about if there was one app that we kept building and refactored to add more features to as we progressed in the course.
---
What if the homework assignments were designed to progressively contribute to a larger, cohesive project by the end of the course? Each session’s homework could build upon the previous one, ultimately culminating in a more comprehensive project that reflects everything we’ve learned.

Unrelated to CSCC, but I wish the Nationwide challenge labs came after this course and not in parallel.
