*pre-req - you already have a github username for class*

## Clone the repo and create a branch

First we are going to clone this repo, and create branch we can push up to GitHub at the end of class.

1) log into your CSCC Linux 2 virtual machine (VM) via https://mypc.cscc.edu
2) open a terminal in the VM
3) In the terminal, run the command `git clone git@github.com:ewagner14-cscc/welcome-students.git`
4) Navigate into the git repo with `cd welcome-students`
5) create a new branch with `git branch -b <username>` where *<username>* is your github user account you created or are using for class.

## Edit the markdown file
  
  Markdown files are special fiels that can produce HTML from their formatting. Very useful in creating documentation in software repositories. We are going to edit the reasons.md file with our reasons for taking this class, save the changes, and push up our branch to github.

  1) In your VM, use either vim, nano, emacs, or the text Editor to edit the reasons.md file. If you add a picture, add it to the static/ folder in this repo.
